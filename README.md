> Creating the model object from teachable machine
Using the teachable machine - it is possible to create a keras / tensorflow model object by;
- Creating a series of image classes / labels
- using the webcam to ingest images conforming to that class to help train the model
- Testing the performance of the model using the class indicator whilst holding the object
- Downloading the model object locally so that it can make a prediction on unseen data
